# ðŸ›’Buyable

A basic full-stack store application developed within Python's Flask framework. It has functionality for searching and filtering out categories for items, and the ability to add multiple items to the shopping cart. This project was more of a demonstration of a full-stack shop interface, and it isnâ€™t designed properly to be used as an actual store application, as thereâ€™s no API integration for payments. You can view [an AWS deployment over here](http://18.222.232.245/) for a live demonstration.

## Credits

This was a group project for Coding Dojo. While I personally don't want to sound like I'm bragging, this project was largely my own work. Being the one who had created the page layout, the back-end functions, and styling for the page. I was even the one who had thought of the idea for a store application as a realistically feasible project to get done in under two weeks, but mostly on one weekend.

However, I can't claim everything as own, so here's what other two people had done for this project:

* **[steigs181:](https://github.com/steigs181)** Came up with the project's name and had several layout ideas. He had contributed to creating the model scripts used for the project, that I ended up having to change thoroughly.
* **[MG1993:](https://github.com/MG1993)** Not sure but was the supportive member for the group project. He did write some routing-related code, but it ultimately never got used.
